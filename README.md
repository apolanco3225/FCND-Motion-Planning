# FCND-Motion-Planning
2nd Project - 3D Motion Planning 


# Explaning the Starter Code

1- Read Global Home , Global Position and Local Position
2- Read "Collider.csv" file and assign those values to a data array
3- Creat Grid via Planning_utils.py
  a-Find North_min , North_max , East_min and East_max
  b-Find Nort and East Size 
  c-Creat a zero grid array by using Step 2 values 
  d-Find obstacles and insert into the grid array 
4- Define Start and Goal Point
5- Run A* Search Algorithm to find parth via Planning_utils.py
6- Create Waypoint List by using Path which is found by A* Search Algorithm ( Step 5 )
7- Send Waypoint List to Simulator
